# Python
Here is where the Python programming will go...

Day 1: 
I started by reading the basic documentation from [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html]
And made a simple script implamenting loops, input functions and more. 

**I used that to create the distwotime.py which calculates distance travelled by taking in the starting speed and end speed as well as acceleration.** 

3 hours

Day 10: 

Using the experience I gained from my last program, I wanted recreate the game hangman. The game itself was quite simple and worked well though a terminal. 
I used the random module to generate psudo random numbers which can be used in order to select a word from my list at 'random'. I included some ascii art I found online and finished off day 2.

**The project is called hangman.py**

5 hours 

Day 20:

Today I was tinkering with lists and realised it was a tetious task to make them from variables you already have, so I decided to make a script that converts a set of variables into a python list for convience. 
It was an easy project but I still learned more features of the print funciton including the end='/r' that I enploy in my code.  

2 hours

Day 30: 

For the past few days I have been working on creating a simple python weather script that uses an external api to calculate the weather on specified cordinates. Learning how to implement apis took some time therefore this project took slightly longer then expected. Overall I am satisfied with the result.
