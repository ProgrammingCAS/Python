# Python
Here is where the Python programming will go...

Day 1: 
I started by reading the basic documentation from [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html]
And made a simple script implamenting loops, input functions and more. 

**I used that to create the distwotime.py which calculates distance travelled by taking in the starting speed and end speed as well as acceleration.** 

Day 2: 

Using the experience I gained from my last program, I wanted recreate the game hangman. The game itself was quite simple and worked well though a terminal. 
I used the random module to generate psudo random numbers which can be used in order to select a word from my list at 'random'. I included some ascii art I found online and finished off day 2.

**The project is called hangman.py**

Day 3:

Today I was tinkering with lists and realised it was a tetious task to make them from variables you already have, so I decided to make a script that converts a set of variables into a python list for convience. 
It was an easy project but I still learned more features of the print funciton including the end='/r' that I enploy in my code.
