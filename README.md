# Python
Here is where the Python programming will go...

Day 1: 
I started by reading the basic documentation from [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html]
And made a simple script implamenting loops, input functions and more. 

**I used that to create the distwotime.py which calculates distance travelled by taking in the starting speed and end speed as well as acceleration.**
